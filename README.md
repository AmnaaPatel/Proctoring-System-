# AN AUTOMATED ONLINE EXAM  PROCTORING SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING
The problem addressed by an online proctoring system lies in the growing need 
for a reliable and secure method of monitoring and invigilating online exams. With the 
increasing popularity of remote learning and online education, educational institutions 
face significant challenges in maintaining the integrity and credibility of assessments 
conducted in virtual environments. The absence of physical supervision during exams 
creates an environment where test-takers may be more inclined to engage in dishonest 
practices, such as cheating or unauthorized collaboration. Ensuring exam integrity 
becomes a critical concern, as educational institutions strive to provide fair and accurate 
assessments that truly reflect the knowledge and abilities of the test-takers. Therefore, 
the problem is to develop an automated online proctoring system that effectively detects 
and deters cheating behaviors, creating a controlled assessment environment that upholds 
the validity and reliability of online exams.
